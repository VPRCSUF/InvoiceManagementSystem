# InvoiceManagementSystem

InvoiceManagementSystem is a text file organization application for invoice management.

## Summary

I got inspiration to create InvoiceManagementSystem after listening to a fellow warehouse employ bring up how difficult it is to carry out the warranty process for parts. A technician will pick up a part from a supplier and receive an invoice, which has information regarding the part. When a part is brought back for warranty, the warehouse manager must search for the purchase date of the part in order to determine if the part is still within the warranty date. Getting something as simple as the purchase date is a tedious task that requires the manager to ask office employees and suppliers for information regarding the purchase. So I figured, this process would be easier if the technician and the warehouse manager used the same system to keep track of part purchases. And with that, I decided to start this project!
